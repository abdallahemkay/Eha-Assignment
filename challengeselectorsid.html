         <p id="lion-thecat">Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. <br>
             The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds. <br>
             A group of lions, also called 'a pride', often roar together to mark their territory. <br>
             A roar can be heard from 5 miles away. <br></p>
